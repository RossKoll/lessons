                <p>Ukraine, the largest country in Europe by land area (excluding Russia), is a nation with a
                    deep-rooted history, a vibrant culture, and a strong sense of identity. Situated in Eastern Europe,
                    it shares borders with Russia, Belarus, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova, with the
                    Black Sea and the Sea of Azov to the south.

                <h2 id="history-title">A Brief History</h2>
                <p class="ukraine-history">Ukraine`s history stretches back thousands of years, with early civilizations
                    such as the Trypillians and Scythians inhabiting the land. However, it is best known as the heart of
                    Kyivan Rus', a powerful medieval state that flourished between the 9th and 13th centuries. The city
                    of Kyiv, Ukraine`s capital, was a major cultural and political center of Eastern Europe.
                </p>
                <p class="ukraine-history-part-two">In later centuries, Ukraine was ruled by various empires, including the Polish-Lithuanian
                    Commonwealth, the Ottoman Empire, and the Russian Empire. In 1917, following the collapse of the
                    Russian Empire, Ukraine briefly declared independence, but by 1922, it was absorbed into the Soviet
                    Union as the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.
                </p>
                <p class="ukraine-history-independence">Ukraine regained its independence in 1991, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, marking a new era for the nation. Since then, it has undergone significant political and economic
                transformations while asserting its sovereignty on the global stage.

                    <h3 class="language-and-literature">Language and Literature</h3>
                    <p>Ukrainian is the official language, known for its melodic sound. The country has produced
                        world-renowned writers such as Taras Shevchenko, whose poetry played a crucial role in shaping
                        Ukraine`s national identity, and Lesya Ukrainka, a celebrated poet and playwright.
                    </p>
                    <p>In addition to its classical literary heritage, Ukraine has a thriving contemporary literary scene. Modern authors such as Serhiy Zhadan, Andrey Kurkov, and Oksana Zabuzhko have gained international recognition for their works, which explore themes of identity, history, and resilience. The preservation and promotion of the Ukrainian language remain central to the nation`s cultural policy, especially in response to historical periods of suppression.</p>

                        performed with acrobatic movements, are a staple of Ukrainian celebrations. The country also has

                <h2>Modern Ukraine and Global Importance</h2>
                <p>Since independence, Ukraine has faced economic and political challenges, including tensions with
                    Russia. The 2014 Revolution of Dignity led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych, signaling
                    a shift toward European integration. However, Russia`s annexation of Crimea and the ongoing conflict
                    in eastern Ukraine have significantly impacted the country.
                </p>
                <p>Despite these challenges, Ukraine has continued to strengthen its democracy and international
                    partnerships. It remains a key player in global food production, as one of the world's largest
                    exporters of wheat and sunflower oil.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Ukraine is a nation of resilience, rich traditions, and a strong will for independence. Whether
                    through its historical significance, cultural contributions, or modern geopolitical role, Ukraine
                    continues to shape the future of Europe and beyond.
