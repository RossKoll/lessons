                </h1>
                <p>Victorian London, spanning the reign of Queen Victoria (1837-1901), was a city of stark contrasts. It was a time of rapid industrial growth, cultural transformation, and extreme social division. While the British Empire flourished, many of London's residents lived in harsh conditions, battling poverty, pollution, and overcrowding.</p>

                <h2>A Growing and Changing City</h2>
                <p>By the mid-19th century, London had become the largest city in the world, with a population exceeding 6.5 million by 1901. The expansion of railways, factories, and docks made it the heart of the British Empire, but it also brought challenges such as pollution and overpopulation. The famous London fog, a mix of smoke and mist, became a defining (and dangerous) characteristic of the city.</p>

                <h3>Society and Class Divide</h3>
                <p>Victorian London was deeply divided by class.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>The Upper Class</span> - The wealthy lived in grand townhouses in areas like Mayfair and Kensington, enjoying luxuries such as fine dining, opera, and social events.</li>
                    <li><span>The Middle Class</span> - Shopkeepers, clerks, and professionals sought to improve their status through education and work.</li>
                    <li><span>The Working Class</span> - Factory workers, servants, and laborers lived in overcrowded slums with poor sanitation, especially in areas like Whitechapel and Southwark.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The poorest of the poor lived in workhouses, where they worked in exchange for food and shelter under harsh conditions. The social reform movement, led by figures like Charles Dickens, highlighted these struggles in books such as Oliver Twist.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Daily Life and Work</h3>
                <p>For the wealthy, daily life included grand parties, education in private schools, and leisure activities like horse riding and afternoon tea. The poor, however, endured long working hours in factories, workshops, and domestic service, often in dangerous conditions.</p>
                <p>Child labor was common, with children working in coal mines, textile mills, and as chimney sweeps. Over time, reforms like the Factory Acts helped improve working conditions and limit child labor.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Crime and the Underworld</h3>
                <p>Victorian London was infamous for its crime. The dark alleys of Whitechapel became the hunting ground of the notorious Jack the Ripper, whose unsolved murders terrified the city. Pickpockets, thieves, and con artists thrived, prompting the expansion of the Metropolitan Police, founded in 1829 by Sir Robert Peel.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Entertainment and Culture</h3>
                <p>Victorians enjoyed theatre, literature, and new forms of entertainment. The period saw the rise of authors like Charles Dickens, Arthur Conan Doyle (Sherlock Holmes), and the Brontë sisters. The expansion of music halls provided entertainment for the working class, while the wealthy attended opera houses and grand exhibitions.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Victorian London was a city of extremes—wealth and poverty, progress and struggle, grandeur and grime. It was a time of incredible growth and innovation, but also of great hardship for many. The legacy of this period can still be seen today in London`s architecture, literature, and social history.</p>
